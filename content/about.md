# The author
Hi, I'm Edoardo! I [BEEP-BOOP](https://twitter.com/mmmverygood/status/1177245793285107712) buttons on the keyboard and code comes out of it.
I am a Software Engineer that loves to be all over the stack, I even enjoy devops.

Things I like (the most):
- Keeping things concise
- Making lists and keeping related details on a single bullet point
- Hiking, scuba diving and weight lifting
- Programming in [Golang](https://golang.org/)
- Cooking, gaming and occasionally sleeping

# The blog
I've opened this blog to write primarily about my programming misadventures,
but I'd also like to publish anything I might find interesting to share.

If, by any chance, we share a common interest, please stick around, you might find something cool to read.
