> "Sorry for the long article"  
> "Sorry for wasting your time"  
> "Sorry for this boring text"

> "Sorry for saying sorry too much"  



I used to be like this: over-apologetic. It drove people mad. It highlighted only the negatives of any situation.

That is why I started saying "Thank You".

Now, this is common knowledge, I know... But bear with me for a second:

> "Thank you for reading my article"  
> "Thank you for your time"  
> "Thank you for paying attention"  
> "Thank you for your patience"  
> "Thank you for listening"  
> "Thank you for bearing with it"  
> "Thank you"  


Not only it sounds better, it even puts a smile on the listener.

However, what people sometime fail to grasp, is that over-using those two magic words ("thank you"), becomes annoying and meaningless pretty quickly.

This means that we should use it carefully and spruce up the way we express gratitude. Either by being more verbose or by complimenting one's virtues.

> "It's really nice that you read through this"  
> "I appreciate your time"  
> "That was a great display of patience"  
> ...so on and so forth.  

Finally, let's remember that, **sometimes**, "sorry" is completely fine. We have that word, and we are supposed to use it when it matters.

There's no way to _thank-you-fy_ a "Sorry to hear that" or a "Sorry I drove my car into your swimming pool".
Nevertheless, start thanking and complimenting people virtues.
It will boost people's morale and make you more likeable!

I wanted to share this piece of information, because it's something that really helped me grow both professionally and as a person.

You reached the end of this post, thank you for your time!
