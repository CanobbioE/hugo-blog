We all heard all about ChatGPT. So I thought to myself: why not make this AI language model write a blog post for me?

It all started with a simple prompt:

```
Hey ChatGPT, write me an article on how AI can be used to write articles.
```

The response was this nice essay, which you don't have to read, but I'll post it here just in case you are curious -- the `TL;DR` is at the end of this blog post:

>Artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly advanced in recent years and is now being used in a wide range of applications, from self-driving cars to personal assistants like Siri and Alexa. One emerging area where AI is being used is in writing articles.  
>
>The use of AI in writing articles is not new. Many news organizations have been using software that automatically generates news stories from raw data for several years now. However, recent advancements in machine learning have opened up new possibilities for the use of AI in writing articles.  
>
>One potential use of AI in writing articles is to automatically generate summaries of existing articles. This can be useful for news organizations that need to quickly provide summaries of breaking news stories to their readers. AI algorithms can quickly read through an article and produce a summary that captures the most important information.  
>
>Another potential use of AI in writing articles is to generate new articles from scratch. This would involve an AI system that is capable of understanding a topic and generating a coherent and well-written article on that topic. While this is still a work in progress, there have been some promising developments in this area.  
>
>One of the challenges with using AI to generate articles is ensuring that the articles are high-quality and accurate. AI systems are only as good as the data they are trained on, so it is important to ensure that the data used to train the AI system is of high quality and accurately represents the topic being covered.  
>
>Another challenge with using AI to generate articles is ensuring that the articles are written in a way that is engaging and interesting to readers. While an AI system may be capable of generating a well-written article, it may lack the creativity and nuance of a human writer.  
>
>Despite these challenges, there are already several examples of AI being used to write articles. For example, the Associated Press has been using software called Wordsmith to automatically generate news articles from data. The articles produced by Wordsmith are reported to be of a high quality and indistinguishable from articles written by human journalists.  
>
> In conclusion, AI is already being used to write articles, and this trend is likely to continue in the future. While there are challenges to overcome, the potential benefits of using AI to write articles are significant, including the ability to quickly generate high-quality content on a wide range of topics. As AI technology continues to evolve, it is likely that we will see even more innovative uses of AI in the field of journalism and beyond.  


I quickly read through it, and the first thing that bugged me is the redundancy between some paragraphs. For example the repetition of "potential use of AI in writing articles" and remix of the sentence. 

Apart from that, the article is well written and any remarks I could make are already highlighted by the AI-generated article.
Speaking of which:

```
Summarize the above article in five lines.
```

> Artificial intelligence (AI) is being used to write articles, including article summaries and generating new articles.  
> Challenges for using AI in article writing include ensuring high-quality and accurate content, as well as engaging and interesting writing.  
> The Associated Press has been using software called Wordsmith to generate news articles from data.  
> Despite challenges, AI offers significant potential benefits for quickly generating high-quality content on a wide range of topics.  
> The future of AI in article writing is likely to see even more innovative uses in journalism and beyond.  


If that's still too much text for you, do not worry because:

```
Compact it to a single line
```

> AI is being used to write articles, but challenges remain, with potential benefits for generating high-quality content quickly, as seen with software like Wordsmith.

In conclusion, text-based AI language models are fun to toy with, but I still have to type all my posts myself.
