What better way to start a programming/technical/anything else blog than describing the journey to set it up?

**TL;DR:** I used Hugo and Netlify to create and deploy the blog and Namecheap.com to buy a cheap domain name.

# A bit of history
Since I started programming I thought about opening my personal blog.
I kept procrastinating due to a lack of time, money, tools and knowledge.
The rare occasions I looked for a solution I always ended up with half solutions
or expensive options.

I found out about [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) when it was still pretty plain,
don't get me wrong it was great, but \<sarcasm\> it wasn't enough for [a man of culture](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/022/506/manofculture.jpg) such as myself \</sarcasm\>.  
Recently (might varies between 1 month and 2 years) I found out about [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
Hugo offers an easy and fast way to create static websites with the option to add a custom or preset theme.
Great! But I needed somewhere to deploy my site and all the available options were pricy or too complicated for young me.


# Opening a blog in 2020
Today nothing much has changed, I still lack the time and the money to invest in a blog.
On the other hand I discovered that Hugo and Netlify works perfectly together.
Though I still wasn't happy with the default namespace Netlify gives you, `canobbioe-netlify.com`
is not really professional. Feeling a bit like a [choosing beggar](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=choosing%20beggar)
I looked for a cheap domain registration service, to my surprise a website named [namecheap.com](https://www.namecheap.com/)
exists. I bought `canobbioe.com` for under 10â‚¬ (around 11$), yay!

# How To
It is time to get to the actual technical part. The first thing I'd like to do is listing which parts I have:
- Domain name
- A place to deploy my site
- A static webpage

Putting together the pieces is easier said than done but here's how I did it:

- [Installed Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) extended
- Created my website from CLI: `$ hugo new site sitename`
- Picked a theme and added it as a `git submodule`.
- Pushed everything to GitHub
- Followed [Hugo's guide](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-netlify/) to deploy with Netlify
- Associated my newly bought domain to Netlify using its dashboard
- Selected `Custom DNS` in the `NAMESERVER` section under `domain list > manage` on namecheap.com
- Changed the domain's nameservers to the ones listed by Netlify under the `DNS settings` tab (see image)

I could've just stop here, but it's 2020 and we must use SSL. To set up HTTPS I just had to wait and wait and sometimes I even waited... Finally the DNS propagation was completed and Netlify took care of the rest.

I run into a problem while deploying the site with the [Sam theme](https://github.com/victoriadrake/hugo-theme-sam):
```
Transformation failed: POSTCSS: failed to transform "css/main.css" (text/css): resource "path/to/resource" not found in file cache. Check your PostCSS installation; install with "npm install postcss-cli". See https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/postcss/
```
The solution is written clearly in the error message: running "npm i -g postcss-cli autoprefixer" before building fixed the problem.

# Conclusion
This little adventure into the land of web hosting and static web pages taught me that \<sarcasm\> I was right all along: procrastinating what seems hard, eventually makes it easy! \</sarcasm\>
