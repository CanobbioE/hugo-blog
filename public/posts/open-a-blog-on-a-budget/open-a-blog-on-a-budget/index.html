        <p>What better way to start a programming/technical/anything else blog than describing the journey to set it up?</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> I used Hugo and Netlify to create and deploy the blog and Namecheap.com to buy a cheap domain name.</p>

<h1 id="a-bit-of-history" class="anchor-link"><a href="#a-bit-of-history">A bit of history<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¶</span></a></h1>
<p>Since I started programming I thought about opening my personal blog.
I kept procrastinating due to a lack of time, money, tools and knowledge.
The rare occasions I looked for a solution I always ended up with half solutions
or expensive options.</p>
<p>I found out about <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> when it was still pretty plain,
don&rsquo;t get me wrong it was great, but &lt;sarcasm&gt; it wasn&rsquo;t enough for <a href="https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/022/506/manofculture.jpg">a man of culture</a> such as myself &lt;/sarcasm&gt;.<br>
Recently (might varies between 1 month and 2 years) I found out about <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>.
Hugo offers an easy and fast way to create static websites with the option to add a custom or preset theme.
Great! But I needed somewhere to deploy my site and all the available options were pricy or too complicated for young me.</p>

<h1 id="opening-a-blog-in-2020" class="anchor-link"><a href="#opening-a-blog-in-2020">Opening a blog in 2020<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¶</span></a></h1>
<p>Today nothing much has changed, I still lack the time and the money to invest in a blog.
On the other hand I discovered that Hugo and Netlify works perfectly together.
Though I still wasn&rsquo;t happy with the default namespace Netlify gives you, <code>canobbioe-netlify.com</code>
is not really professional. Feeling a bit like a <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=choosing%20beggar">choosing beggar</a>
I looked for a cheap domain registration service, to my surprise a website named <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">namecheap.com</a>
exists. I bought <code>canobbioe.com</code> for under 10€ (around 11$), yay!</p>

<h1 id="how-to" class="anchor-link"><a href="#how-to">How To<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¶</span></a></h1>
<p>It is time to get to the actual technical part. The first thing I&rsquo;d like to do is listing which parts I have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Domain name</li>
<li>A place to deploy my site</li>
<li>A static webpage</li>
</ul>
<p>Putting together the pieces is easier said than done but here&rsquo;s how I did it:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/">Installed Hugo</a> extended</li>
<li>Created my website from CLI: <code>$ hugo new site sitename</code></li>
<li>Picked a theme and added it as a <code>git submodule</code>.</li>
<li>Pushed everything to GitHub</li>
<li>Followed <a href="https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-netlify/">Hugo&rsquo;s guide</a> to deploy with Netlify</li>
<li>Associated my newly bought domain to Netlify using its dashboard</li>
<li>Selected <code>Custom DNS</code> in the <code>NAMESERVER</code> section under <code>domain list &gt; manage</code> on namecheap.com</li>
<li>Changed the domain&rsquo;s nameservers to the ones listed by Netlify under the <code>DNS settings</code> tab (see image)
<p style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="/posts/open-a-blog-on-a-budget/cheapname.PNG" alt="Cheap"  />
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I could&rsquo;ve just stop here, but it&rsquo;s 2020 and we must use SSL. To set up HTTPS I just had to wait and wait and sometimes I even waited&hellip; Finally the DNS propagation was completed and Netlify took care of the rest.</p>
<p>I run into a problem while deploying the site with the <a href="https://github.com/victoriadrake/hugo-theme-sam">Sam theme</a>:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Transformation failed: POSTCSS: failed to transform &#34;css/main.css&#34; (text/css): resource &#34;path/to/resource&#34; not found in file cache. Check your PostCSS installation; install with &#34;npm install postcss-cli&#34;. See https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/postcss/
</code></pre><p>The solution is written clearly in the error message: running &ldquo;npm i -g postcss-cli autoprefixer&rdquo; before building fixed the problem.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion" class="anchor-link"><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¶</span></a></h1>
<p>This little adventure into the land of web hosting and static web pages taught me that &lt;sarcasm&gt; I was right all along: procrastinating what seems hard, eventually makes it easy! &lt;/sarcasm&gt;</p>
